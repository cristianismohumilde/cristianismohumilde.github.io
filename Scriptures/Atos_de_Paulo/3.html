        Capítulo III</br></br>
    1. Eles traem a Paulo. Tâmiris o prende com oficiais.
    </br></br>
    Então disse Tâmiris: Venham comigo para minha casa e se refresquem. Assim, eles foram a um esplêndido entretenimento, onde havia vinho em abundância e comida farta.
    </br></br>
    2. Eles foram levados a uma mesa ricamente posta e obrigados a beber abundantemente por Tâmiris, devido ao amor que ele tinha por Tecla e ao seu desejo de se casar com ela.
    </br></br>
    3. Então Tâmiris disse: Desejo que me informem quais são as doutrinas desse Paulo, para que eu possa compreendê-las; pois estou muito preocupado com Tecla, vendo que ela se deleita tanto com os discursos daquele estrangeiro, que estou em perigo de perder minha futura esposa.
    </br></br>
    4. ¶ Então Demas e Hermógenes responderam juntos, e disseram: Levem-no perante o governador Castélio, como alguém que tenta persuadir o povo à nova religião dos cristãos, e ele, de acordo com a ordem de César, o matará, com o que você obterá sua esposa;
    </br></br>
    5. Ao mesmo tempo, a ensinaremos que a ressurreição da qual ele fala já chegou e consiste em ter filhos; e que então ressuscitamos, quando chegamos ao conhecimento de Deus.
    </br></br>
    6. Tâmiris, tendo recebido esta informação deles, ficou furioso:
    </br></br>
    7. E levantando-se de manhã cedo, dirigiu-se à casa de Onésimo, acompanhado pelos magistrados, o carcereiro e uma grande multidão de pessoas com varapaus, e disse a Paulo:
    </br></br>
    8. Tu pervertiste a cidade de Icônio e, entre outras, Tecla, que está prometida a mim, de modo que agora ela não quer se casar comigo. Portanto, você irá conosco ao governador Castélio.
    </br></br>   
    9. E toda a multidão gritou: Fora com esse impostor [mágico], pois ele perverteu as mentes de nossas esposas, e todo o povo o escuta.
    </br></br>
        p. 103

    (magician), for he has perverted the minds of our wives, and all the people hearken to him.

    III
    </br></br>
    When he was departed from Antioch and taught in Myra (Myrrha).
    </br></br>
    When Paul was teaching the word of God in Myra, there was there a man, Hermoerates by name, who had the dropsy, and he put himself forward in the sight of all, and said to Paul: Nothing is impossible with God, but especially with him whom thou preachest; for when he came he healed many, even that God whose servant thou art. Lo, I and my wife and my children, we cast ourselves at thy feet: have pity on me that I also may believe as thou hast believed on the living God.
    </br></br>
    Paul said unto him: I will restore thee (thine health) not for reward, but through the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt become whole in the presence of all these. (And he touched his body) drawing his hand downwards: and his belly opened and much water ran from him and . . . he fell down like a dead man, so that some said: It is better for him to die than to continue in pain. But when Paul had quieted the people, he took his hand and raised him up and asked him, saying: Hermocrates, ask for what thou desirest. And he said: I would eat. And he took a loaf and gave him to eat. And in that hour he was whole, and received the grace of the seal in the Lord, he and his wife.
    </br></br>
    But Hermippus his son was angry with Paul, and sought for a set time wherein to rise up with them of his own age and destroy him. For he wished that his father should not be healed but should die, that he might soon be master of his goods. But Dion, his younger son, heard Paul gladly.
    </br></br>
    Now all they that were with Hermippus took counsel to fight against Paul so that Hermippus . . . and sought to kill him
    </br></br>
    Dion fell down and died: but Hermippus watered Dion with his tears.
    </br></br>
    But Hermocrates mourned sore, for he loved Dion more than his other son. (Yet) he sat at Paul's feet, and forgat that Dion was dead. But when Dion was dead, his mother Nympha rent her clothes and went unto Paul and set herself before the face of Hermocrates her husband and of Paul. And when Paul saw her, he was aifrighted and said: Wherefore art thou thus, Nympha? But she said to him: Dion is dead; and the whole multitude wept when they beheld her. And Paul looked upon the people that mourned and sent young men, saying to them: Go and bring me him hither. And they went: but Hermippus caught hold of the body (of Dion) in the street and cried out
    </br></br>
    A leaf lost.
    </br></br>
    the word in him (them?). But an angel of the Lord had said unto him in the night: Paul, thou hast to-day a great conflict against thy body, but God, the Father of his Son Jesus Christ, will protect thee.
    </br></br>
    When Paul had arisen, he went unto his brethren, and remained (sorrowful?) saying: What meaneth this vision? And while Paul thought upon this, he saw Hermippus coming, having a sword drawn in his hand, and with him many other young men with staves. And Paul said unto them: I am not a robber, neither a murderer. The God of all things, the Father of Christ, will turn your hands backward, and your sword into its sheath, and your strength into weakness: for I am a servant of God, though I be alone and a stranger, and small and of no reputation (?) among the Gentiles. But do thou, 0 God, look down upon their counsel and suffer me not to be brought to nought by them.
    </br></br>
    And when Hermippus ran upon Paul with his sword drawn, straightway he ceased to see, so that he cried out aloud, saying: My dear comrades, forget not your friend Hermippus. For I have sinned, 0 Paul, I have pursued after innocent blood. Learn, ye foolish and ye of understanding, that this world is nought, gold is nought, all money is nought: I that glutted myself with all manner of goods am now a beggar and entreat of you all: Hearken to me all ye my companions, and every one that dwelleth in Myra. I have mocked at a man who hath saved my father: I have mocked at a man who hath raised up my brother Dion . . . I have mocked at a man who . . . without doing me any evil. But entreat ye of him: behold, he hath saved my father and raised up my brother; he is able therefore to save me also. But Paul stood there weeping alike before God, for that he heard him quickly, and before man, for that the proud was brought low. And he turned himself and went up . . . But the young men took the feet and bore Hermippus and brought him to the place where Paul was teaching and laid him down before the door and went unto their house. And when they were gone a great multitude came to the house of Hermocrates; and another great multitude entered in, to see whether Hermippus were shut up there. And Hermippus besought every one that went in, that they would entreat Paul, with him. But they that went in saw Hermocrates and Nympha, how they rejoiced greatly at the raising up of Dion, and distributed victuals and money unto the widows for his recovery. And they beheld Hermippus their son in the state of this second affliction, and how he took hold on the feet of every one, and on the feet of his parents also, and prayed them, as one of the strangers, that he might be healed. And his parents were troubled, and lamented to every one that came in, so that some said: Wherefore do these weep? for Dion is arisen. But Hermocrates possessed goods . . . and brought the value of the goods and took it and distributed it. And Hermocrates, troubled in mind and desiring that they might be satisfied, said: Brethren, let us leave the food . . . . and occupy ourselves . . . Hermocrates. And immediately Nympha cried out in great affliction unto Paul . . they said: Nympha, Hermocrates calleth upon God that your son Hermippus may see and cease to grieve, for he hath resisted Christ and his minister. But they and Paul prayed to God. And when Hermippus recovered his sight, he turned himself to his mother Nympha, and said to her: Paul came unto me and laid his hand upon me while I wept, and in that hour I saw all things clearly. And she took his hand and led him unto the widows and Paul. But while Paul wept bitterly, Hermippus gave thanks, saying unto them: Every one that believeth, shall . . .
    </br></br>
    A leaf gone
    </br></br>
    . . . concord and peace . . . Amen.
    </br></br>
    And when Paul had confirmed the brethren that were in Myra, he departed unto Sidon.
